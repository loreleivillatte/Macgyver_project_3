# game_macgyver

Help macgyver get out of the labyrinth.

To get out of the labyrinth alive, macgyver must collect randomly scatter objects (one needle, on plastic tube and one flask of ether)
in order to create a syringe that will fall asleep the guard.

Use the arrow keys on the keybord to move MacGyver.
